# Terms and Conditions

On this website you can take part in the creation of the Samrómur database. By participating, you submit your own voice recording and, as appropriate, demographic information, reviews, and feedback that will be useful in creating an open voice database.

The database will be accessible at [www.samromur.is](https://samromur.is/gagnasafn). With the creation of the voice database, it will be possible to support and strengthen the development of language technology solutions for Icelandic.

## Participation in the creation of the Samrómur database

Everyone can participate in the creation of the Samrómur database.

You can participate in three ways. Reading a sentence ("audio clip") and submitting a recording of your voice, reviewing the audio clips others have recorded or repeating a sentence read up for you. Repeating a sentence is mostly aimed towards people with reading disorders, visually impaired or children. Reviewing audio clips involves listening to audio recordings recorded by other participants and confirming that the sentence given matches the audio recording. If the audio clip does not meet the aforementioned conditions, the audio clip must be rejected. It is important not to reject audio clips based on your own taste in how to read, the voice samples should form a diverse collection of voices of all Icelanders, who have diverse accents and backgrounds.

As a participant, you agree that all of your contributions (voice recordings, and, as appropriate, demographic information, reviews, and feedback) will be covered by the [Creative Commons by attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

In order to participate, you need to enter demographic information, i.e. age range, gender and mother tongue. By entering demographic information about yourself, you confirm that it is recorded with integrity and is true. False and incorrect information can adversely affect data collection.

In order for minors to participate, a guardian's permission is required. If a participant is a minor, he or she must obtain permission from the guardian to participate in the creation of the database. To do this, the participant must provide his or her ID number and the e-mail address of the guardian. The guardian then receives an email and is asked to respond to it by clicking on a link. The guardian thereby gives consent for the ID number in question to participate in Samrómur. This information will not be published with the database and will not be stored longer than necessary.

Participants can choose to provide information indicating which school or company they participate for. This information is only used to keep track of group participation and competitions and may be published on the site's website. The information will not be published with the database or stored longer than necessary.

## Accessing the database(s)

Samrómur will be published under an open license called [Creative Commons by attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The data providers that will offer downloads of the database will be listed on [Samrómur's website](https://samromur.is/gagnasafn).

## Privacy

If you provide a contribution in the form of a voice sample and, as the case may be, demographic information, the information may in some cases be personally identifiable. The Reykjavík University (RU) [privacy statement](https://samromur.is/personuverndaryfirlysing) states how RU uses personally identifiable information.

## Communication

If you subscribe to Samrómur's mailing list, RU will occasionally send you emails about the progress of the project, important milestones and possibly other material related to the project. You are given the opportunity to unsubscribe from the mailing list in all letters sent by e-mail.

## Cookies

The Samrómur website contains cookies. Cookies are encrypted text strings that a web page stores on the user's computer. Cookies allow us to minimize the likelihood of participants being invited to review their own audio clips. In addition, cookies are used to measure the use of various pages within the website, but this helps us assess what needs to be improved on the page. The cookies are "session cookies" and "persistent cookies". Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted when you leave the website. Persistent cookies remain on your computer until you delete them. We do not use cookies to collect information about your visits to other sites, nor to collect personal information about you, other than that which you have voluntarily registered with us through communication with us on our website.

## Disclaimer

Reykjavík University is exempt from any liability for the use of the database by third parties, which is accessible to anyone with a [Creative Commons by attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## Violation of terms

If the participant’s breach of these terms is discovered, RU reserves the right to remove the participant's contribution from the database.

## Other

You can contact us via the email address samromur@ru.is. Terms of participation in the creation of the Samrómur database are reviewed regularly and may therefore change.
